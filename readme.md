# fifa analysis
In this repository, I explore fifa data from the perspective of a club manager.
My goal is to gain insights on how to build a better team.

## source
This data comes from [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/fifa-18-demo-player-dataset).
It contains:
* Player personal attributes (Nationality, Club, Photo, Age, Value etc.)
* Player performance attributes (Overall, Potential, Aggression, Agility etc.)
* Player preferred position and ratings at all positions.

Note that it does not contain any game data, such as points scored, or any club data,
such as numbers of wins.
